# HackFS 2021

Hello HackFS'ers

We are excited to to participate with you to build the decentralized web.


## The Opportunity

Fluence provides the infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute in form of applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. To this end, Fluence provides Aqua, a new-gen language to program distributed networks and services into decentralized applications.

Fluence service are comprised of Wasm IT modules that execute on Fluence peer-to-peer network nodes and these modules, for example, can be stored on IPFS and deployed to the peer-to-peer network with Aqua. See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpZOjTVYiA) for a demo. Moreover, Aqua allows developers to bring peer-to-peer compute to a variety of use cases including, but not limited, IPLD and IPNS.


## The Prizes

Fluence is offering three prices in the named category:

* USD 2,000 for the best use of Aqua to use Fluence compute to IPLD solutions such as 
    * indexing and searching of IPFS hosted blogs or web sites
    * indexing and searching of blockchain IPLD data
    * creating [content addressable archive](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/) (CAR) file readers and writers

* USD 2,000 for the best functional solution providing a performant IPNS solution with Aqua. For example, use [Aqua DHT](https://github.com/fluencelabs/aqua-dht) as the a name registry or name registry cache to speed up IPNS

* USD 2,000 for the best integration of Fluence compute with Ceramic or Textile data layers or identities


## The Submission

* You may use the Fluence [devcontainer](https://github.com/fluencelabs/devcontainer) to develop your solution in a repo of your choice
* Please add a detailed Readme, or even better, a short video to explain your idea and implementation
* Feel free to contact the Fluence team to ask questions

# HackFS 2021

Hello HackFS'ers

We are excited to to participate with you to build the decentralized web.


## The Opportunity

Fluence provides the infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute in form of applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. To this end, Fluence provides Aqua, a new-gen language to program distributed networks and services into decentralized applications.

Fluence service are comprised of Wasm IT modules that execute on Fluence peer-to-peer network nodes and these modules, for example, can be stored on IPFS and deployed to the peer-to-peer network with Aqua. See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpZOjTVYiA) for a demo. Moreover, Aqua allows developers to bring peer-to-peer compute to a variety of use cases including, but not limited, IPLD and IPNS.


## The Prizes

Fluence is offering prices in both the pool and named categories.

### Pool Prizes:

* USD 1,000 for best use of hosting a Fluence backend on IPFS using Aqua-IPFS

* USD 1,000 for the best use Aqua to add compute capabilities to any IPFS solution, e.g., blog, web site or IPLD in general

### Named Prices

* USD 2,000 for the best functional solution that brings [IPFS DAG])https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/cli/#ipfs-dag) bindings to ipfs-aqua and builds a project on that 

* USD 1,000 for the best functional solution providing a performant [IPNS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipns/#example-ipns-setup-with-cli ) solution with Aqua

Please note that named prices may be combined with pool prizes. Moreover, there may be opportunities to extend a project past HackFS.

## The Submission

* You may use the Fluence [devcontainer](https://github.com/fluencelabs/devcontainer/tree/with-tutorial) to develop your solution in a repo of your choice
* Please add a detailed Readme, or even better, a short video to explain your idea and implementation
* Feel free to contact the Fluence team to ask questions

# HackFS 2021

Hello HackFS'ers

We are excited to to participate with you to build the decentralized web.


## The Opportunity

Fluence provides the infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute in form of applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. To this end, Fluence provides Aqua, a new-gen language to program distributed networks and services into decentralized applications.

Fluence service are comprised of Wasm IT modules that execute on Fluence peer-to-peer network nodes and these modules, for example, can be stored on IPFS and deployed to the peer-to-peer network with Aqua. See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpZOjTVYiA) for a demo. Moreover, Aqua allows developers to bring peer-to-peer compute to a variety of use cases including, but not limited, IPLD and IPNS.


## The Prizes

Fluence is offering three prices in the **named** category:

* USD xxx for the best integration of Fluence compute and Ceramic streams  [optional]
* USD xxx for the best integration of Fluence compute and Textile threads  [optional]

* USD 500.00 for the best, functional implementation of Aqua bindings to [IPFS DAG](https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/cli/#ipfs-dag) similar Fluence's [IPFS Adapter](https://github.com/fluencelabs/ipfs-adapter). Maximum of three prizes.

* USD 1,000 for the best use of Aqua to add Fluence compute to IPLD solutions such as  IPFS hosted blogs or web sites

Please note that there may be opportunities to extend a project past HackFS.

## The Submission

* You may use the Fluence [devcontainer](https://github.com/fluencelabs/devcontainer/tree/with-tutorial) to develop your solution in a repo of your choice
* Please add a detailed Readme, or even better, a short video to explain your idea and implementation
* Feel free to contact the Fluence team to ask questions
